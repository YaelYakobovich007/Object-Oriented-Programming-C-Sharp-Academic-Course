## 1. **Garage Management System**:
The **Garage Management System** is a console-based application written in **C#** that allows users to manage various vehicles within a garage. It utilizes core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, such as **polymorphism**, **inheritance**, and **abstraction**, to handle a variety of vehicle types.

### Key Features:
- **Vehicle Management**: The system supports cars, motorcycles, and trucks, each having specific attributes such as fuel type, battery charge, and wheel air pressure.
- **Services**: Users can track the repair status of vehicles, refuel or charge electric vehicles, inflate tires, and manage vehicle ownership data.
- **Status Tracking**: Easily check the current status of any vehicle and update repair statuses (In Progress, Fixed, Paid).
- **Modular and Extendable**: The system can be expanded to include new vehicle types or additional services with minimal code changes due to its flexible design.

## 2. **Memory Game**:
The **Memory Game** is a console-based game developed using **C#**, where players flip pairs of cards on a board, attempting to match them. This game uses OOP principles to separate game logic and UI, making it easy to expand or modify. 

### Key Features:
- **Single and Multiplayer Modes**: Players can compete against a friend or play against the computer (AI).
- **Dynamic Board Size**: The game supports customizable board sizes, allowing for varied difficulty levels.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The game board is updated dynamically during each playerâ€™s turn, with cards flipping and matching pairs being revealed.
- **AI Integration**: The computer opponent utilizes simple algorithms to simulate a challenging experience for players.
- **Scoring System**: The game tracks each player's score based on the number of matching pairs found, and declares a winner at the end.

## 3. **Hierarchical Menu System**:
This project demonstrates the power of **interfaces** and **delegates** in C# by implementing a **Hierarchical Menu System**. This system allows for nested menus, providing flexible and scalable management of menu options and user commands.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Menu Structure**: Supports the creation of dynamic, nested menus with flexible user interactions.
- **Action<T> Delegates**: Uses **delegates** to manage menu actions, allowing for efficient handling of different operations without hardcoding.
- **Modular and Reusable**: Each menu and submenu is built to be modular, allowing for reuse across different sections of an application.
- **User Navigation**: The system ensures smooth navigation between different menu levels, with support for triggering actions at each level.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling for invalid menu selections, ensuring a seamless user experience.
